# Neomorphic-PortfolioTemplate

This is a OpenSource Portfolio Template Based on Neomorphic Theme. 

# What is Neomorphic?
Neomorphism is a relatively new design movement and a phrase that has just gained popularity. <br> Its aesthetic is defined by minimal and realistic-looking UI, which is a new twist on skeuomorphism. <br> It got its name in a UX Collective post from December 2019, and since then, various design and development communities have been actively discussing the trend, usually with differing opinions. <br> Chris poked fun at it on Twitter. Adam Giebl created an online generator for it. <br> Developers, designers, and UX specialists are weighing in on the topic of aesthetics, usability, accessibility, and practicality of this design trend.
